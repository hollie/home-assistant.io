The Flume integration will show you the current [Flume](https://flumewater.com/) status for the given Device ID.

Flume monitors the real-time status of your home water meter. Allowing the end-user to detect small leaks, gain real-time information on household water consumption, set water goals and budgets, and receive push notifications when suspicious water activities occur. 

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

You can find your Client ID and Client Secret under "API Access" on the [settings page](https://portal.flumewater.com/#settings).

To add `Flume` to your installation, go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations select **Flume**.

## Notifications

Flume notifications are available via binary sensors. To clear the notifications, you will need to use your Flume app or go to: [https://portal.flumewater.com/notifications](https://portal.flumewater.com/notifications) and clear the notification in question.

The following notifications are supported:

- Bridge disconnected
- High flow
- Leak detected


## Configuration for Binary Sensor

The following YAML creates a binary sensor. This requires the default sensor to be configured successfully.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
    - name: "Flume Flow Status"
      state: >-
        {{ states('sensor.flume_sensor') != "0" }}
```

{% endraw %}
