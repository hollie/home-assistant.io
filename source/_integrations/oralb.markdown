Integrates [Oral-B](https://oralb.com/) devices into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The Oral-B integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional. 

The integration can discover most Bluetooth-enabled Oral-B toothbrushes. Brushes not listed as supported below may not be correctly identified or have some modes missing.
