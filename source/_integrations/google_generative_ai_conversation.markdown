The Google Generative AI integration adds a conversation agent powered by [Google Generative AI](https://developers.generativeai.google/) in Home Assistant.

This conversation agent is unable to control your house. The Google Generative AI conversation agent can be used in automations, but not as a [sentence trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-trigger). It can only query information that has been provided by Home Assistant. To be able to answer questions about your house, Home Assistant will need to provide Google Generative AI with the details of your house, which include areas, devices and their states.

This integration requires an API key to use, [which you can generate here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Generate an API Key

The Google Generative AI API key is used to authenticate requests to the Google Generative AI API. To generate an API key take the following steps:

- Join the PaLM API and MakerSuite [waitlist](https://makersuite.google.com/waitlist).
- Wait several days for an email with subject "Itâ€™s your turn to use the PaLM API and MakerSuite".
- Visit the [API Keys page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to retrieve the API key you'll use to configure the integration.
