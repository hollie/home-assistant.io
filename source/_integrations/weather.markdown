The `weather` platforms gather meteorological information from web services and display the conditions and other details about the weather at the given location. Read the integration documentation for your particular weather provider to learn how to set it up.

Home Assistant currently supports free web services some of which require registration.

## State and state attributes

A weather entity's state is used to indicate the current overall conditions, e.g. 'cloudy' or 'sunny'.
### Condition mapping

The `weather` platform only knows the below listed conditions. The reason for this is that for these conditions is an icon from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) available and mapped in the frontend.

- 'clear-night'
- 'cloudy'
- 'fog'
- 'hail'
- 'lightning'
- 'lightning-rainy'
- 'partlycloudy'
- 'pouring'
- 'rainy'
- 'snowy'
- 'snowy-rainy'
- 'sunny'
- 'windy'
- 'windy-variant'
- 'exceptional'

### State attributes

Detailed weather conditions as well as the unit of measurements used for the conditions are indicated by state attributes. A weather entity may not support all the state attributes.

{% raw %}
```yaml
apparent_temperature: 12.0
cloud_coverage: 0
dew_point: 5.0
humidity: 76
precipitation_unit: mm
pressure: 1019
pressure_unit: hPa
temperature: 14.2
temperature_unit: Â°C
uv_index: 2
visibility: 10
visibility_unit: km
wind_bearing: 260
wind_gust_speed: 51.56
wind_speed: 35.17
wind_speed_unit: km/h
```
{% endraw %}

## Service `weather.get_forecast`

Weather integrations which support weather forecasts expose the forecast using services. The services provided by weather entities are described below, and you can also read more about [Service Calls](/docs/scripts/service-calls/).

<div class='note'>

Some integrations may not support the `weather.get_forecast` service, but instead expose weather forecasts as a state attribute named `forecast`. This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Home Assistant Core.

</div>

This service populates [Response Data](/docs/scripts/service-calls#use-templates-to-handle-response-data)
with a weather forecast.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `type` | no | The type of forecast, must be one of `daily`, `twice_daily` or `hourly`. | daily

{% raw %}
```yaml
service: weather.get_forecast
target:
  entity_id: weather.home
data:
  type: daily
response_variable: weather_forecast
```
{% endraw %}

The response data field `forecast` is a list of forecasted conditions at a given point in time:

| Response data | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `datetime` | The time of the forecasted conditions. | 2023-02-17T14:00:00+00:00
| `is_daytime` | Only set for `twice_daily` forecasts. | False
| `apparent_temperature` | The apparent (feels-like) temperature in the unit indicated by the `temperature_unit` state attribute. | 10.2
| `cloud_coverage` | The cloud coverage in %. | 15
| `condition` | The weather condition. | Sunny
| `dew_point` | The dew point temperature in the unit indicated by the `temperature_unit` state attribute. | 6.0
| `humidity` | The relative humidity in %. | 82
| `precipitation_probability` | The probability of precipitation in %. | 0
| `precipitation` | The precipitation amount in the unit indicated by the `precipitation_unit` state attribute. | 0
| `pressure` | The air pressure in the unit indicated by the `pressure_unit` state attribute. | 1019
| `temperature` | The temperature in the unit indicated by the `temperature_unit` state attribute. If templow is also provided, this is the higher temperature. | 14.2
| `templow` | The lower temperature in the unit indicated by the `temperature_unit` state attribute. | 5.0
| `uv_index` | The UV index. | 3
| `wind_bearing` | The wind bearing in azimuth angle (degrees) or 1-3 letter cardinal direction. | 268
| `wind_gust_speed` | The wind gust speed in the unit indicated by the `wind_speed_unit` state attribute. | 34.41
| `wind_speed` | The wind speed in the unit indicated by the `wind_speed_unit` state attribute. | 24.41
