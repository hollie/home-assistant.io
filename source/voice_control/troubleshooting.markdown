## Test a sentence per language without voice: without executing commands

If you want to test if a sentence works in a specific language without actually executing the commands, use the sentence parser in the **Developer tools**.

1. Go to  {% my developer_assist title="**Developer tools** > **Assist**" %}.
2. In the sentence parser, select the language and enter the sentence you want to test.
3. The debug tool shows you the following:
   - The intent triggered.
   - The entities that were targeted.
   - Which of the targeted entities were matched.

## Test a sentence per assistant without voice: while executing the commands

If you want to test if a sentence works with a specific assistant while actively executing the commands, use the sentence parser in the **Debug** view.

1. [Open the debug view](#view-debug-information).
2. In the top right corner, select the icon.

3. Select the assistant you want to test.
4. Select **Run text pipeline**.
![Open the pipeline debug dialog](/images/assist/assistant-debug-pipeline-01.png)
5. Enter the phrase you want to test and select **Run**.

6. Check if it worked.
![Open the pipeline debug dialog](/images/assist/assistant-debug-pipeline-03.png)
   - If the phrase does not work, try a variant. For example, if *Turn off the light* doesn't work, try: *Turn off the lights in the kitchen*.
   - Check if your phrase is [supported](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/).
   - Make sure you are using the name of the area as it is defined in Home Assistant. If you have a room called *bathroom*, the phrase *Turning on the lights in the bath* wonâ€™t work.

## I do not see any assistant

If under {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %} you do not see any assistants, you are not using the default configuration. The image below shows the **Assist** section.

If the **Assist** section is missing entirely, you need to add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   # Example configuration.yaml entry
   assist_pipeline:
   ```
